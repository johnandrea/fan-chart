# fan-chart.py

A program which will produce a full circle genealogy descendant fan chart from a GEDCOM input. The 
output is intended to be used for large sheet printing at print services such as Staples (see below).

Reasons for making my own program:

- scriptable
- orient the text for reading on a large printed sheet: horizontal to outside edge and consistently clockwise

## Features

- Scriptable.
- Output is an SVG file.
- Makes use of [readgedcom.py](https://github.com/johnandrea/readgedcom) library.

## Limitations

- Requires Python 3.6+
- GEDCOM input ought to be well formed (use a verification tool)

## Installation

No installation process. Copy the program and the library.

## Printing

Some printers, even at print services such as Staples, cannot print directly from SVG. In these cases an option is to convert the output to PDF. There exist online converters, however for scripted work a solution is to use Inkscape in its command line mode to perform the conversion.

```
/path/inkscape --export-filename=NAME.pdf NAME.svg
```

## Input

The input is a GEDCOM file exported from a genealogy program.

## Options

gedcom-file

Full path to the input file.

top-person

Id of the person at the top of the tree to be output. Value of this id depends on the "id-item" setting.

--id-item=value

Specify the item to identify the tester via each tester id. Default is "xref" which is the individual
XREF value in the GEDCOM file.
Other options might be "uuid", "refn", etc. If using a GEDCOM custom type specify it as "type." followed by
the type name, i.e. "type.extid", "type.refnumber", etc.

--generations=number

Maximum number of generations to output. Default 5.
In theory there is no upper limit, but around 12 the text gets too small to be useful for a reasonably
sized hardcopy paper sheet.

--colour=colour scheme

Currently only black and white (BW). Default BW.

--dates=none or year or full

Include dates in the output. Default is none.

--libpath=directory-containing-readgedcom

Location containing the readgedcom.py library file. The path is relative to the program being used. An absolute path will not work. Default is the same location as the program (".").

--version 

Display the version number then exit

## Usage

```
program in-file id-top-person > out.svg
```

### Future enhancements

- More colours
- B/W or greyscale selection which will work well on B/W printers
- Alternately start with a specific family, in cases where a person more than one
- Handle non-ASCII names in a manner better for SVG output.
- Output to SVG or PDF
